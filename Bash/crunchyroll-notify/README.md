# Crunchyroll Anime Release Notifier

## Description

This script monitors Crunchyroll RSS feeds for new anime releases and filters the results based on the userâ€™s specified language dubs. The script supports notifications through multiple services, including email, Pushover, Slack, Discord, and more. It also uses a cron job to reset the notification list daily, ensuring fresh updates with each run.

## Features

- Filters anime releases by user-specified dubs.
- Supports notifications through:
  - Email
  - Pushover
  - IFTTT
  - Slack
  - Discord
  - Echo (output to terminal)
- Cron job integration to reset the notification list daily.
- Easy configuration via `config.json`.

## Prerequisites

- `jq`
- `curl`
- `xmlstarlet`
- `bash`
- `cron`

These dependencies must be installed on your system. The script will attempt to install missing dependencies based on your operating system.

## Installation

1. Download this script and modules:

2. Ensure that required tools are installed:
   ```bash
   ./crunchyroll-notify.sh
   ```

   The script will automatically check if the required tools (`jq`, `curl`, `xmlstarlet`, etc.) are installed. If any are missing, it will attempt to install them.

## Configuration

Before running the script, you need to configure it by setting your preferences in `./cfg/config.json`.

### Configuration File Structure

Here is the default `config.json` structure:

```json
{
  "cron_time": "0 0 * * *",
  "anime": {
    "Example Anime": "ExampleDub",
  },
  "notification_services": {
    "email": false,
    "pushover": false,
    "ifttt": false,
    "slack": false,
    "discord": false,
    "echo": true
  },
  "announcerange": 60,
  "announced_file": "/tmp/announced_series_titles",
  "email_recipient": "your_email@example.com",
  "pushover": {
    "user_key": "your_pushover_user_key",
    "app_token": "your_pushover_app_token"
  },
  "ifttt": {
    "event": "your_ifttt_event",
    "key": "your_ifttt_key"
  },
  "slack": {
    "webhook_url": "https://hooks.slack.com/services/your/slack/webhook/url"
  },
  "discord": {
    "webhook_url": "https://discord.com/your/discord/channel/webhook/"
  }
}
```

### Steps to Configure

1. **Set your desired cron schedule**:
   - Modify `"cron_time"` to determine how often the script should check for new anime releases. The default is set to run daily at midnight (`0 0 * * *`).

2. **Specify which anime titles to monitor**:
   - Under `"anime"`, replace `"Example Anime"` with actual anime titles you want to monitor from the Crunchyroll RSS feed.
   - The format is `"<Anime Title>": "<Dubs>"`. The dubs are a comma-separated list of languages (e.g., `"English,German"`).

3. **Configure Notification Services**:
   - Under `"notification_services"`, enable or disable services (`email`, `pushover`, `ifttt`, etc.) by setting them to `true` or `false`.
   - Make sure to configure the relevant fields such as `"email_recipient"`, `"pushover"` keys, and Slack/Discord webhook URLs if those services are enabled.

4. **Adjust announcerange**:
   - The `"announcerange"` field specifies the time range in minutes in which new anime releases should be considered for notification.

## Running the Script

Once configured, you can run the script:

```bash
./crunchyroll-notify.sh
```

The script will:
1. Check for new anime releases from the Crunchyroll RSS feed.
2. Filter releases by the specified dubs in `config.json`.
3. Send notifications through the selected services.

If `config.json` is missing, the script will automatically create one with default values and prompt you to configure it.

## Setting Up Cron

To ensure the script runs periodically, you can install the cron job as specified in `config.json`:

```bash
crontab -e
```

Add the following line to schedule the script according to the `cron_time` specified in your config:

```bash
0 0 * * * /path/to/crunchyroll-notify.sh
```

This example will run the script daily at midnight. You can modify the schedule based on your needs.
