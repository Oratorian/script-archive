### Batch Password Generator 1.0

This Batch script is a simple, interactive password generator. It allows users to create passwords of a specified length, composed of random numbers, letters (both uppercase and lowercase), and special characters. It also includes functionality to copy the generated password to the clipboard and logs the generated password along with an optional user comment into a log file (`PWGen_Log.ini`).

### Features

- **Password Length Configuration**: Allows users to set the password length, with a valid range between 1 and 100 characters.
- **Random Password Generation**: The script generates a password using a mix of:
  - Numbers (0-9)
  - Lowercase letters (a-z)
  - Uppercase letters (A-Z)
  - Special characters (`@`, `#`, `$`, etc.)
- **Clipboard Integration**: Automatically copies the generated password to the clipboard for easy pasting.
- **Password Logging**: The generated password is logged in the `PWGen_Log.ini` file, with a timestamp, the selected password length, and an optional user-provided comment.
- **Menu System**: A simple command-line menu allows users to:
  1. Set the password length
  2. Generate a new password
  3. Exit the program

### Usage

1. **Set the Password Length**: When prompted, users can define the length of the password, within a range of 1 to 100 characters.
