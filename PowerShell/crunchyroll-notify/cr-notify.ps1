## Version: 2.0.1

# Changelog

## [2.0.1] - 2024-09-27
### Fixed
# - Added the `ModuleToProcess` field to `.psd1` manifest files to correctly link `.psm1` files, resolving an issue where modules were not being loaded during import.

### Added
# - Specified module dependencies in the `.psd1` manifest files using the `RequiredModules` field to ensure that required modules (e.g., `BurntToast`, `Pester`) are automatically loaded or installed when the module is imported.

#---

## [2.0.0] - 2024-09-26
### Major Changes
# - Refactored the script into a modular architecture by separating functions into individual PowerShell modules.
# - Implemented manifest files for each module for better modularity and reusability.
# - Changed versioning to Semantic Versioning (SemVer) from 4-digit versioning.

#---

## [1.2.0] - 2024-09-26

### Added
# - Added `$checkinterval` variable for controlling the interval between RSS feed checks, defaulting to 10 minutes, with configurable options.
# - Added `Confirm-IntervalWarning` function to alert users when the check interval is set to less than 10 minutes, with an option to proceed or set a new interval.
# - Introduced user-configurable logging options (`$GlobalLogToFile`, `$GlobalDebug`) allowing logging to console, file, or both, controlled via config without editing `Write-LogMessage` calls.

### Changed
# - Refined `Write-LogMessage` to support logging configuration, reducing the need for manual changes when switching between logging modes.
# - Reworked the check interval logic so `Confirm-IntervalWarning` returns the final interval value, which is used for future checks, preventing reliance on initial config values.
# - Integrated user confirmation for check intervals less than 10 minutes and added handling for setting a new interval if declined.

### Fixed
# - Corrected a bug where setting an interval below 10 minutes would still use the original value from the config due to improper value reassignment logic.
# - Fixed an issue where incorrect log messages were displayed when setting new intervals that did not meet the minimum threshold.
# - Adjusted logic for checking `seriesTitle` and dub permissions to ensure the proper handling of allowed dubs and titles from `$userMediaIDs`.

# ---

## [1.1.1] - 2024-09-25

### Changed
# - Adjusted the logging mechanism to include color-coded messages for warnings, errors, and normal logs, enhancing visual debugging.
# - Updated the structure of RSS feed handling due to the flattened XML returned by `Invoke-RestMethod`, eliminating reliance on nested item structures.
# - Modified the notification system to use BurntToast with clickable buttons (`New-BTButton`) to open the episode URL when clicked.

### Fixed
# - Resolved an issue where all anime titles were being announced instead of filtering by `$userMediaIDs`.
# - Corrected the RSS feed parsing logic to ensure items are processed from the flattened XML structure and not dependent on nested `channel.item`.
# - Addressed a minor logging issue where incorrect messages were being shown when setting a new check interval below the allowed range.

# ---

## [1.1.0] - 2024-09-24

### Added
# - Introduced support for clickable notifications using BurntToast `New-BTButton` to launch the episode link directly from the tray notification.
# - Added `$userMediaIDs` to filter specific series based on user preferences, allowing users to track only their chosen anime series.
# - Implemented a time range check using `$announceRange`, limiting notifications to episodes within a certain release window (in minutes).

### Changed
# - Replaced hardcoded time ranges with the `$announceRange` variable, giving users control over the time window for which episodes are announced.
# - Added color-coded log messages throughout the script to improve readability and debug output.

### Fixed
# - Fixed an issue where tray notifications did not send clickable buttons for watching the episode link directly from the notification.
# - Corrected the dub filtering logic to ensure only allowed dubs are notified.
# - Resolved a bug with `seriesTitle` and `episodeTitle` parsing, ensuring titles are correctly processed and logged.

# ---

## [1.0.0] - 2024-09-22

### Added
# - Initial release of the script with basic RSS feed parsing functionality using `Invoke-RestMethod` to fetch Crunchyroll updates.
# - Implemented series title and dub filtering based on user input via `$userMediaIDs`.
# - Added time-based filtering to ensure episod# es within a certain time window are notified.
# - Introduced BurntToast for tray notifications of new episode releases.

# ----------------
# Config Start
# ----------------

# User-specified seriesTitle to check
# To obtain the seriesTitle visit https://www.crunchyroll.com/rss/calender and look for something like this - > <crunchyroll:seriesTitle>Bye Bye, Earth</crunchyroll:seriesTitle> < -
# You need to do this for all shows you want to get a release notifycation for.
# Add them into the array below, each show in a new line
# Format is like this "Title"="Dubs" Where Dubs is a comma seperated list of dubs to announce (Since Japanese is standard DUB it will always get announced and does not need to be specified here)
$userMediaIDs = @{
    "Wistoria: Wand and Sword" = ""  # Add more series as needed
    "Tower of God" = ""
}

# Time difference range in minutes for announcements
$announceRange = 60

# File to keep track of announced series titles
$announcedFile = "$env:TEMP\announced_series_titles"

# Logging Configuration
$GlobalLogToFile = $true   # Set to $false to disable logging to file
$GlobalDebug = $true      # Set to $true to log to both file and console

#Checkinterval in seconds default: 600 (10min)
# ATTENTION : Everything lower then 10 minutes can result in an IP ban on the rss feed. Typicall values are 10 - 15 min on each rss sync
$GlobalCheckInterval = 10  # Default check interval in minutes
